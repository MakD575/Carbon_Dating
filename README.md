# Carbon_Dating
In this project we used a python script in order to calculate the approximate age of an object using Carbon-14 dating and displayed the results in a decay over time graph.
Due to the complex nature of carbon dating and the required instrumentation, such as a mass spectrometer, the user has to have prior knowledge of the Carbon 14 to Carbon 12 ratio of the sample and then input it into the app.
Once known the user simply inputs the ratio into the app and is shown a decay over time graph and the approximate age of the sample.
